# Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that walks through a complete data analysis pipeline. It is designed to help users understand how to load, clean, explore, and visualize data to extract meaningful insights. The project is ideal for beginners as well as intermediate users looking to solidify their data analysis skills in Python.

## Files

- `main.ipynb`: The primary notebook file that contains step-by-step analysis using popular Python libraries. The notebook includes data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and interpretation of results.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Efficiently imports datasets using pandas.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, removes duplicates, and prepares data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uses descriptive statistics and visualizations to explore data distributions and relationships.
- **Data Visualization**: Creates informative plots using matplotlib and seaborn to illustrate trends, patterns, and outliers.
- **Summary and Interpretation**: Provides concise summaries and interprets the results to help draw actionable conclusions.
